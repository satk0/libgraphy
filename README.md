# Debugging

## Using Python:

1. Create a new virtual environment in a new directory.
2. install libgraphy with:

    pip install libgraphy

## Using Jupyter:

1. Create a new virtual environment (kernel).
2. Make any change to the codebase.
3. Reinstall libgraphy (as for Python) and **restart the kernel**.
